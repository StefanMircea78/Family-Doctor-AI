# Family-Doctor-AI
Family Doctor AI
[Final project for the Building AI course]

## Summary

This project is intended to be a help in the daily work of family doctors.
It can be divided into several levels of medical assistance for patients, for example 3 levels, simple or easy, medium and advanced.
I will address level 1 and partially 2.
Level 1 assistant:
This level will mainly work for prescribing monthly or quarterly drug prescriptions for patients in relatively good health condition between the ages of 18 and 50.
It is useful for patients whose treatment does not change and the medication prescription is periodic without the need for changes or adjustments.

Level 2 assistant:
This level is for patients who have comorbidities, more complex drug treatment and the supervision and approval of the family doctor is also needed.
Within this level, the treatment of patients can be modified or adjusted based on some analyzes performed [blood tests, x-rays, MRI, etc.].
Depending on the patient's profile, referrals for consultations with specialist doctors [orthopaedics, endocrinology, neurology, pneumology, etc.] can be prescribed.
A list of basic analyzes specific to the patient's condition can be prescribed, but with the consent of the family doctor and depending on the patient's illness.

Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 

## Background

This type of AI would solve the following problems encountered in family doctors' offices:
- the relatively long waiting time even with an appointment
- faster issuance of drug prescriptions
- relieving family doctors and increasing the time allocated for consultations of patients with more serious medical problems.


Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
